[![Check Links](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee-action/actions/workflows/links.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee-action/actions/workflows/links.yml)

Quickly check links in Markdown, HTML, and text files using [lychee].

When used in conjunction with [Create Issue From File](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-issue-from-file), issues will be created when the action finds link problems.

## Usage

Here is a full example of a GitHub workflow file:

It will check all repository links once per day and create an issue in case of errors.
Save this under `.github/workflows/links.yml`:

```yaml
name: Links

on:
  repository_dispatch:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron: "00 18 * * *"

jobs:
  linkChecker:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Link Checker
        id: lychee
        uses: lycheeverse/lychee-action@v1.3.2
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}

      - name: Create Issue From File
        if: ${{ steps.lychee.outputs.exit_code }} != 0
        uses: peter-evans/create-issue-from-file@v3
        with:
          title: Link Checker Report
          content-filepath: ./lychee/out.md
          labels: report, automated issue
```

### Alternative approach:

This will check all repository links during any git push event and for all pull
requests. If there's an error, it will fail the action. This has the benefit of
ensuring that during a Pull Request, no link is added that is broken and any
existing link will be caught if they become broken. Save this under
`.github/workflows/links-fail-fast.yml`:

```yaml
name: Links (Fail Fast)

on:
  push:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  linkChecker:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Link Checker
        uses: lycheeverse/lychee-action@v1.3.2
        with:
          fail: true
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
```

## Passing arguments

This action uses [lychee] for link checking.
lychee arguments can be passed to the action via the `args` parameter.
On top of that, some other inputs are supported: `format`, `output`, and `fail`.

```yml
- name: Link Checker
  uses: lycheeverse/lychee-action@v1.3.2
  with:
    # Check all markdown and html files in repo (default)
    args: --verbose --no-progress './**/*.md' './**/*.html'
    # Use json as output format (instead of markdown)
    format: json
    # Use different output filename
    output: /tmp/foo.txt
    # Fail action on broken links
    fail: true
```

See [lychee's documentation][lychee] for all possible arguments.

## Excluding links from getting checked

Add a `.lycheeignore` file to the root of your repository to exclude links from
getting checked. It supports regular expressions. One expression per line.

## Optional environment variables

Issues with links will be written to a file containing the error report.
The default path is `lychee/out.md`. The path and filename may be overridden with the following variable:

- `LYCHEE_OUT` - The path to the output file for the Markdown error report

## Fancy badge

Pro tip: You can add a little badge to your repo to show the status of your links.
Just replace `org` with your organisation name and `repo` with the repository name and put it into your `README.md`:

```
[![Check Links](https://github.com/org/repo/actions/workflows/links.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/org/repo/actions/workflows/links.yml)
```

It will look like this:

[![Check Links](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee-action/actions/workflows/links.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee-action/actions/workflows/links.yml)


## Troubleshooting and common problems

See [lychee's Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee/blob/master/docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
for solutions to common link-checking problems.

## Performance

A full CI run to scan 576 links takes approximately 1 minute for the [analysis-tools-dev/static-analysis](https://github.com/analysis-tools-dev/static-analysis) repository.

## Security and Updates

It is recommended to pin lychee-action to a fixed version [for security reasons](https://francoisbest.com/posts/2020/the-security-of-github-actions).
You can use dependabot to automatically keep your Github actions up-to-date.
This is a great way to pin lychee-action, while still receiving updates in the future.
It's a relatively easy thing to do.

Create a file named `.github/dependabot.yml` with the following contents:

```yml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: ".github/workflows"
    schedule:
      interval: "daily"
```

When you add or update the `dependabot.yml` file, this triggers an immediate check for version updates.
Please see [the documentation](https://help.github.com/github/administering-a-repository/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates) for all configuration options.

### Security tip

For additional security when relying on automation to update actions you can pin the action to a SHA-256 rather than the semver version so as to avoid tag spoofing
Dependabot will still be able to automatically update this.

For example:

```yml
- name: Link Checker
  uses: lycheeverse/lychee-action@cb79c9607b37671965f8dbb54cae47795758a440 #1.1.1
  #...
```

## Credits

This action is based on [peter-evans/link-checker](https://github.com/peter-evans/link-checker) and uses lychee (written in Rust) instead of liche (written in Go) for link checking. For a comparison of both tools, check out this [comparison table](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee#features).
